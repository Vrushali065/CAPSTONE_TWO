## ðŸ“‹ Abstract

<p>Currently Rental bikes are introduced in many urban cities for the enhancement of mobility comfort. It is important to make the rental bike available and accessible to the public at the right time as it lessens the waiting time. Eventually, providing the city with a stable supply of rental bikes becomes a major concern. The crucial part is the prediction of bike count required at each hour for the stable supply of rental bikes.


> My goal is to develop a model that is highly accurate, with a low mean absolute error and a high R-squared value. The model should also be able to provide insights into the factors that most impact bike demand, helping the bike sharing company to make data-driven decisions about how to optimize their operations.

## ðŸ—º Roadmap and Navigation guide

<hr>

### Step 1: Data Collection
Collect the historical bike demand date. Include variables such as weather, time, week days, and traffic.

<hr>

### Step 2: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Clean the dataset by removing any missing values, outliers, or errors. Preprocess the dataset by scaling or normalizing the features as necessary.

<hr>

### Step 3: Model Building
Divide the dataset into training and testing sets. Implement Multiple Regression models to predict the bike demand. Tune the models by adjusting the hyperparameters to optimize performance.

<hr>

### Step 4: Model Evaluation
Evaluate the models' performance using Recall and Precision. Compare the performance of the models to determine which one performs better.

<hr>

### Step 5: Results and Conclusion
Present the results of the model. Discuss the implications of the results and their potential impact on investors. Provide conclusions and suggestions for future research.

## :scroll: Conclusion

We train a model to predict the number of rented bike count in given weather conditions. First, we do Exploratory Data Analysis on the data set. We look for null values that is not found in dataset and outliers and appropriately modify them. We also perform correlation analysis to extract out the important and relevant feature set and later perform feature engineering.

Gradient Boosting gridsearchcv model shows promising result with R2 score of 0.91, therefore it can be used to solve this problem.
Temperatue, Functioning_Day_Yes, Humidity, Rainfall and Solar radiation are major driving factors for the Bike rent demand.
Bike demand shows peek around 8-9 AM in the morning and 6 - 7pm in the evening.
People prefer to rent bike more in summer than in winter.
Bike demand is more on clear days than on snowy or rainy days.
Temperature range from 22 to 25(Â°C) has more demand for bike.
Although the current analysis may be insightful, it is important to note that the dataset is time-dependent and variables such as temperature, windspeed and solar radiation may not always remain consistent. As a result there may be situations where the model fails to perform well. As field of machine learning is constantly evolving, it is necessary to stay uo-to-date with the latest developments and be prepared to handle unexpected scenarios. Maintaining a strong understanding of Machine Learning concepts will undoubtely provide an advantage in staying ahead in the future.
